They were initially bred as hypoallergenic guide dogs, but their friendly personalities and low-shedding coats quickly made them popular as family pets. Labradoodles come in a range of sizes, from miniature to standard, and their coats can be curly, wavy, or straight. They are highly intelligent and trainable, making them well-suited for activities such as obedience, agility, and therapy work.
